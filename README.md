# Consolidated_report
This repository is a repository of tasks for a student at the Avito Academy of Analysts. This is where I collect and store my homework and class projects to track my learning progress and develop my analytical skills.

## What you will find in my repository:

### Hometasks
This section contains my completed homework assignments. Here I save all the tasks that are provided to me in the Avito Academy of Analysts and share them with my teachers and classmates.

### Educational material
In this section I store useful materials and resources that are provided to me during the courses. These are lectures, tutorials and any other materials that can help me learn analytical skills.

This repository helps me structure my learning and allows me to save my progress.
